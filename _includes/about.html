         Welcome to my personal website! I'm a fift year at the Ohio State University, enthusiastically majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and planning on
         graduating in December 2021. 
         I plan on focusing on the cross disciplinary application of critical thinking and electrical engineering onto the medical device field. 
         At Ethicon, I had put that to use as a Quality Engineering co-op as part of their digital surgery team, learning every day from a great team of people. 
         At Stryker, this has been carried out on the Advanced Operations team, working with R&D, Quality, and Operations teams to make the line more efficient.</p>
